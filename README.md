# Experimental_Design_R
This repository contains R functions developed for experimental designs focusing on parameter estimation and identifying the Least Favorable Configuration (LFC). These functions utilize simulation techniques and normal approximation methods to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of statistical analyses.
